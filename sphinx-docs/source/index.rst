**RosettaSilentToolbox** (``rstoolbox``) is a Python library to visualize, analyze and select
the designs of interest from a design population. It exploits the power of `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
to ease on the selection of decoys of interest and provide a direct interface to `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
and `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_ plotting.


For a more detailed idea on the benefits of using this package, you will want to read the :ref:`introductory notes <introduction>`.
Then you should start in the :ref:`installation page <installing>`.
If you are not comfortable with scripting, ``rstoolbox`` offers some :ref:`direct executables <scripts>` to automatically generate analysis from your data.
If you want to exploit the full possibilities of the library, you should probably follow the :ref:`tutorials <tutorial>` and then explore
the :ref:`API <api>`.
