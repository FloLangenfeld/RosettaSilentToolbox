#. Patch bug that will crash FASTA sequence output when sequence identifier is a number.
#. Adds utility function to change the text of a legend on plotting.
#. Adds function to ensure logic in fragment data is properly kept.
#. Adds function to mix fragment data.
#. Adds function to generate qgrids as per the [qgrid library](https://qgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is a simple wrapper that just makes sure that the ``html div`` overflows if the number of columns is too high. Adds a soft requirement to the library.
