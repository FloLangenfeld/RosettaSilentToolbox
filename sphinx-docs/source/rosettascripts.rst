RosettaScripts
==============

The `RosettaScripts interface <https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/RosettaScripts>`_ is one of the most flexible
ways to combine different protocols into a full design pipeline.

Most `Movers <https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/Movers/Movers-RosettaScripts>`_,
`SimpleMetrics <https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/SimpleMetrics/SimpleMetrics>`_
and `Filters <https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/Filters/Filters-RosettaScripts>`_ store their evaluation values as
regular scores, which can be directly picked by the ``rstoolbox`` and properly selected, if needed, through the specified :ref:`reading options <readrosetta>`.

Still, ``rstoolbox`` is also prepared to pick specially formatted data generated by particular elements:

* `DisplayPoseLabelsMover <https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/xsd/mover_DisplayPoseLabelsMover_type>`_ adds to the
  silent files the labels assigned to the residues of a design. This can be picked up through the :ref:`labels option <readrosetta>`.

* `WriteSSEMover <https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/xsd/mover_WriteSSEMover_type>`_ can append secondary structure
  identification (**DSSP**), secondary structure prediction (**PSIPRED**) and phi/psi angles to the silent file, which can be read with the
  :ref:`structure, psipred and dihedrals options <readrosetta>`.

.. tip::
  **Are you using a different design platform that is not Rosetta?**

  Just :ref:`add you parser <contributing>` to start taking advantage of ``rstoolbox`` in your own pipeline.
